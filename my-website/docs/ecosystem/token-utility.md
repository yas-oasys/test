Animechain tokens are at the core of the Animechain.ai ecosystem and serve as the foundation for streamlining value exchange within the ecosystem. The need for this token stems from the reason that using blockchain technology allows transactions to be recorded transparently and reliably, preventing fraudulent or opaque transactions. Furthermore, token-based transactions are faster and have lower fees compared to traditional financial systems, reducing economic burdens and making it easier for more participants to join the ecosystem.

Providing rewards for contributions to the ecosystem through tokens enables creators, fans, and AI developers to actively participate, promoting the revitalization and sustainable growth of the ecosystem. For example, creators receive tokens for creating new works, studios receive tokens for production support, AI developers receive tokens for technology development, and fans earn tokens for supporting works.

Holders of Animechain tokens have the right to participate in the governance of the ecosystem. This ensures fair and transparent operation by allowing all token holders to participate in decision-making. Participating in governance enhances the sense of community and engagement, promoting the sustainable development of the ecosystem. Specifically, votes are held on launching new projects and changing the direction of the ecosystem, reflecting the will of token holders.

Animechain tokens also function as incentives for contributing to the ecosystem. This activates the activities of creators, fans, and AI developers, realizing sustainable growth. For example, various forms of contributions such as participating in community events, sharing content, and providing feedback are evaluated and rewarded with tokens.
