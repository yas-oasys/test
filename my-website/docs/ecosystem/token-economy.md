The distribution plan for Animechain tokens is strategically designed to promote the growth of the ecosystem. The allocation of tokens to each stakeholder is clearly defined, supporting the development of the entire ecosystem. Tokens are provided to creators as rewards for creating new works, to studios as rewards for production support and project management, to AI developers as rewards for developing and improving generative AI technology, and to the community as rewards for contributing to the ecosystem, such as participating in events and providing feedback.

The circulation method of tokens and the mechanism for managing inflation are important elements supporting the sustainable development of the ecosystem. The circulation volume of tokens is appropriately adjusted according to the growth and demand of the ecosystem, stabilizing the value of tokens and maintaining a healthy economic environment. Furthermore, the supply of tokens is regularly reviewed for inflation management, maintaining the long-term value of tokens and ensuring the sustainable growth of the ecosystem. This allows for adjusting the supply of tokens to prevent excessive inflation and maintain the balance of the entire ecosystem.

Animechain.ai's token economy is an important element supporting the growth and sustainability of the ecosystem. Animechain tokens promote the revitalization and sustainable growth of the ecosystem through value exchange, governance participation, and providing incentives. This creates an environment where all participants can participate with peace of mind, and creators can continue to produce high-quality works.
