### Market Size and Growth Forecast

The anime industry has experienced continuous growth over the past 50 years. Japanese animation, which began in the 1960s, has become a cultural phenomenon with significant influence not only domestically but also internationally. From the 1980s to the 1990s, the popularity of anime further increased, giving birth to globally renowned works.

In recent years, the proliferation of streaming platforms has dramatically changed the viewing environment for anime. With the emergence of global streaming services like Netflix, anime has become accessible to viewers worldwide. This widespread availability has led to rapid expansion of the anime market, with reports indicating that the market size of the anime industry exceeded $24 billion in 2019.

Furthermore, projections for the anime market size up to 2030 suggest an annual growth rate exceeding 8%, with the potential for the market size to reach $100 billion. Anime is no longer limited to a specific age group but has evolved into content enjoyed by all age demographics. This growth demonstrates anime's ability to appeal to a wide audience by addressing diverse genres and themes.
