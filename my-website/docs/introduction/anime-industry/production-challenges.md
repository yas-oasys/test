### Shortage of Human Resources in Production Sites and Need for Efficiency

While digitalization is progressing in anime production, a severe labor shortage remains a significant challenge. There is a shortage of personnel across all areas, including animators, background artists, and production coordinators, leading to production companies being overwhelmed with orders. Currently, if one requests production from a famous studio, there is a waiting period of 3 to 4 years, making it difficult to supply works flexibly.

In an environment that demands rapid response to market needs, the labor shortage in production is causing lost opportunities. Particularly in the production of sequels to popular works or series, the inability to release timely content risks diminishing viewer interest. Additionally, while significant success could be expected if games were released immediately following an anime hit, the development of games containing animation takes time, preventing sales maximization.

The need for efficiency is increasingly urgent, necessitating the introduction of digital tools and AI technologies. This would automate routine tasks and operations targeted for efficiency improvement, allowing creators to focus on more creative work and tasks that significantly contribute to the quality of the work. The utilization of AI technology is expected to improve animation production speed and stabilize quality.
