### Challenges in Global Expansion

The global popularity of anime is rising, increasing demand for localization and local versions. However, the shortage of personnel to address this and delays in understanding market needs pose challenges. In particular, beyond translation, subtitling, and dubbing work, content modifications may be necessary to accommodate different cultures, languages, and religions. In such cases, while localization needs to be carried out primarily by local members, there is often a lack of specialized knowledge and skills related to anime production.

Moreover, adjustments to comply with local laws and regulations are necessary, which can slow down global expansion. For example, strict copyright management is required in Western markets, and there may be a lack of resources to address this.

To avoid missed opportunities in the global market, it is essential to streamline the localization process and quickly grasp market needs. This allows for timely release of anime works, meeting viewer expectations.
