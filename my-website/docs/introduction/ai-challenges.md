## Challenges Brought by Generative AI

While the rapid advancement of generative AI technology brings many benefits to anime production, it also presents several challenges.

Copyright issues with training data: Current generative AI systems collect and learn from large amounts of data from the internet, but much of this data may have copyright or licensing issues. Using unauthorized data without permission from copyright holders can pose legal risks of copyright infringement. Moreover, most mainstream generative AI systems (as of July 2024) do not presuppose paying compensation to creators and artists who provided training data. This situation fails to protect the rightful entitlements of copyright holders and data providers.

Usability for creators and lack of quality: Current generative AI is often not immediately usable in anime production environments. The inability to fine-tune outputs to match the style and direction of a work, and the lack of models specialized for specific genres or styles that directors and producers want to express, create challenges in producing desired outputs. Furthermore, not only the development, adjustment, and modification of the base models themselves, but also the operation of AI tools to handle these outputs and customize results require specialized knowledge, making it difficult for creators to easily utilize them at present. This creates barriers to maximizing creators' creativity. To solve this problem, it is necessary to improve both the AI models themselves and the literacy of users.

Challenges in sustainable development of AI models: Continuous evolution of generative AI requires learning from high-quality data and continuously learning new data. Providing appropriate compensation to data providers and building an economic sphere centered on AI models are challenges. Additionally, training advanced generative AI models requires a large amount of computational resources, represented by GPUs, which is one of the difficulties in continuously developing AI models and having everyone benefit from them.

To address these challenges, it is essential to ensure transparency in data collection, model training and synthesis, and usage history, and to build a system that respects the rights of creators and IPs, along with the infrastructure to provide GPUs to continuously realize this. It is also important to improve the quality and consistency of generative AI model outputs and provide tools and interfaces that creators can easily use. Animechain.ai offers innovative solutions to address these challenges.
