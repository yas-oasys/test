### Potential Applications of Generative AI in Anime Production

<img src="/img/img1_era.png" className="custom-img"/>


Generative AI can be applied to various processes in anime production. For instance, utilizing AI in areas such as character design, background art, and video production can help alleviate labor shortages, reduce production costs, and shorten production periods.

In character design, AI can automatically generate diverse designs as samples, supporting creators' idea generation. For background art, AI can create visuals of realistic landscapes or fantasy worlds, improving production efficiency. In the video production process, AI can perform in-between frame generation (tweening) and assist in the finishing process by correcting lines and coloring, enhancing the quality and consistency of animations.

With AI support, creators can focus on more creative processes and high-value tasks that improve the overall quality of the work. As AI technology continues to evolve, the range of these applications is expected to expand further. In particular, as AI can learn individual characteristics and styles, it is anticipated that it will be utilized at more advanced levels, broadening the scope of creativity.
