### Rapid Progress of Generative AI Technology

Generative AI technology has been advancing rapidly in recent years. Particularly, the development of large language models (such as OpenAI's GPT-4 or its future successors) and image/video generation AI technologies are having a significant impact on anime production. These technologies learn from vast datasets and possess the ability to generate high-quality images and videos.

Specific examples include generative AI's capability to automatically propose character designs or generate scene backgrounds. This greatly improves efficiency in the ideation and design work during the initial stages of production. Additionally, by having creators adjust prototypes generated by AI, the overall production process speed increases while maintaining quality.
