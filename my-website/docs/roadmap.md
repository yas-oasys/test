## Milestones in Technology Development


### Prototype Development and Proof of Concept

Animechain.ai's prototype development plan aims to conduct technical verification in the early stages. First, basic functions are implemented, and proof-of-concept experiments are conducted to confirm the practical usability in anime production sites. This identifies initial technical challenges and considers solutions to them. Specifically, the focus is on improving the accuracy of AI generation models, streamlining data management, and ensuring the stability of blockchain infrastructure.


### Advanced Anime-Specific AI Models

The next milestone is to improve the performance of anime-specific AI models and add new functions. This phase actively incorporates feedback from creators to improve the usability and quality of AI models. For example, more advanced AI technologies are introduced, such as automating character design, rendering complex scenes, and generating background art. User interface improvements are also made in parallel to enhance usability.


### Expanding and Enhancing Blockchain Infrastructure

Expansion and enhancement of the blockchain infrastructure are also important milestones. This includes improving scalability, enhancing transaction processing speed, and strengthening security. Furthermore, smart contracts are advanced to promote the automation of rights management and compensation distribution. This builds a robust foundation to support the growth of the entire ecosystem.


## Strategies for Ecosystem Expansion


### Partnerships with Anime Production Companies

The first step in expanding the ecosystem is to build partnerships with major anime production companies. This introduces Animechain.ai's technology into actual anime production sites and demonstrates its effectiveness. Through joint development and pilot projects, specific success stories are created, demonstrating the reliability and usefulness of the technology.


### Forming and Supporting Creator Communities

The formation and support of the creator community are also important elements of ecosystem expansion. Through workshops, events, and grants, creators' activities are promoted, and their creativity is maximized. Furthermore, building an online community activates the exchange and sharing of information between creators, supporting the growth of the entire community.


### Global Market Expansion

Ultimately, Animechain.ai aims for global expansion. Collaborations with overseas anime studios and creators are strengthened, and the formation of local communities is promoted. This enables creators from around the world to participate in the Animechain.ai ecosystem, realizing the exchange of technology and knowledge from a global perspective. Furthermore, marketing activities in local areas increase awareness of Animechain.ai and establish an international presence.

Through these strategies, Animechain.ai simultaneously realizes technological progress and ecosystem expansion, aiming to innovate the future of anime production.
