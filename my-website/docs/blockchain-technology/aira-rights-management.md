### Current Challenges in Anime Generative AI

While anime generative AI greatly contributes to the efficiency and quality improvement of anime production, there are currently several challenges. Understanding these challenges and introducing technologies and mechanisms to solve them is important.


#### Ethical Issues with Training Data:



* Transparency of data collection and use: Current generative AI collects and learns from a large amount of data from the internet, much of which has copyright and licensing issues. Using data without permission is ethically problematic and carries the risk of copyright infringement.
* Compensation for data providers: Creators and artists who provided training data may not be adequately guaranteed fair compensation. This can lead to insufficient protection of data providers' rights.


#### Lack of Quality and Consistency in Generated Content:



* Style consistency: Current generative AI may have difficulty consistently generating specific styles and qualities. It is important for anime characters and background art to maintain a consistent visual style throughout the work, but this requires advanced tuning to achieve with AI.
* Quality variations: There may be variations in quality between frames of generated animations. Particularly, fine adjustments of AI are essential to maintain the naturalness of character movements and expressions.


#### Difficulty of Collaboration between Creators and AI:



* Usability issues: Operating AI tools and customizing results often require specialized knowledge, making them not easily accessible to all creators. This creates barriers to fully unleashing creators' creativity.
* Interface improvements: There is sometimes a lack of interfaces that allow creators to intuitively interact with AI. This raises the hurdle for effectively utilizing AI.


#### Challenges in Sustainable Development and Updating of AI Models:



* Model training costs: Training advanced generative AI models requires a large amount of computational resources and time. This makes it difficult to quickly introduce new technologies and models.
* Continuous improvement and learning: Continuous data collection and model updating are necessary to maintain the performance of AI models. However, efficiently advancing learning while maintaining the quality and quantity of data is not easy.

To address these challenges, it is essential to ensure transparency in data collection and use and establish mechanisms that respect creators' rights. It is also important to improve the quality and consistency of generative AI models and provide tools and interfaces that creators can easily use. Animechain.ai provides innovative solutions to solve these challenges.


### Managing Rights Information on the Blockchain

Animechain.ai utilizes blockchain technology to manage rights information for works transparently and tamper-resistantly. The characteristics of blockchain ensure that all transactions and data are recorded in a distributed ledger, making interference or fraud by third parties virtually impossible. This ensures that creators' copyrights are reliably protected and prevents tampering and unauthorized use of data.


#### Specific benefits of managing rights information using blockchain technology include:



* Ensuring transparency: All rights information and transaction history are made public and accessible to anyone. This clarifies the owners of rights and usage status.
* Tamper-resistance: Blockchains are operated in a distributed manner, and once data is recorded, it becomes extremely difficult to tamper with. This guarantees the reliability of rights information.
* Utilization of smart contracts: Automated contracts (smart contracts) efficiently and accurately perform rights transfer and revenue distribution.

Specifically, all data generated during the production process of a work is recorded on the blockchain, and its traceability is ensured. This makes it clearly traceable which data was used for training which AI models and which models generated works were generated from. For example, all data used for character designs in a work and information related to background art are recorded, and creators and rights holders can check their usage history.


### Automation of Rights Processing through Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are contracts that are automatically executed on the blockchain when conditions are met. Animechain.ai utilizes smart contracts to automate rights processing. This ensures that compensation distribution to creators is performed quickly and accurately, ensuring transparency and fairness.


#### Specific functions of smart contracts include:



* Automatic distribution: When revenue is generated, smart contracts automatically distribute the revenue to creators and rights holders. This prevents delays and fraud in revenue distribution.
* Conditional rights transfer: A mechanism can be constructed where rights are transferred only when specific conditions are met. For example, it is possible to set rights to be transferred only after a certain amount of revenue is generated.
* Execution guarantee: Smart contracts are executed by program code, eliminating human errors and interference. This ensures reliable fulfillment of contracts.

As an actual example, when a work is published and revenue is generated, that revenue is automatically distributed to creators by smart contracts. This entire process is performed on the blockchain, realizing highly reliable rights processing without the intervention of a third party. Furthermore, the distribution ratio and conditions of revenue are preset and shared transparently with all parties involved.


### Concept and Mechanism of AIRA

AIRA (AI Rights Asset) is a subdivision of usage rights and beneficial interests of generative AI for specific anime IPs. AIRA plays an important role within the Animechain ecosystem. Specifically, AIRA manages usage rights for generative AI models related to specific anime IPs and distributes a portion of revenue to owners.


#### The main functions of AIRA include:



* Management of usage rights: Usage rights for specific generative AI models are subdivided and issued as tokens. This allows creators and investors to own usage rights for AI models in a tokenized form.
* Revenue distribution: By owning AIRA tokens, one has the right to receive a portion of the revenue generated from the use of AI models. This allows creators and investors to directly enjoy revenues.
* Trading on the secondary market: AIRA tokens are tradable on the blockchain, enabling buying and selling on the secondary market. This ensures the liquidity of AIRA tokens, allowing owners to trade freely.

For example, when a creator uses an AI model to produce a new anime work, they purchase AIRA tokens to obtain usage rights for that AI model. When the work is published and revenue is generated, a portion of that revenue is distributed to AIRA token holders. This mechanism enables developers and data providers of AI models to receive fair compensation as well.


### New Value Creation Brought by AIRA

AIRA has the potential to create new value in the anime industry. First, AIRA promotes the production of derivative works and spin-off works. Creators can utilize AIRA to produce new works based on existing anime IPs and share the revenue. This revitalizes the entire anime industry and creates new business opportunities.
