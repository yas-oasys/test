### Application of Layer 2 Scaling Solution to Animechain.ai

Animechain.ai introduces a Layer 2 solution to improve the efficiency and scalability of the entire ecosystem. Layer 2 technology significantly enhances transaction processing capacity and reduces transaction costs. This allows users to execute transactions quickly and at low cost.


### Necessity of Developing a Proprietary Layer 2

There are several important challenges in current anime generative AI. First, data related to anime production is highly confidential and may not be adequately managed on public blockchains. When managing data on public blockchains, there are concerns about data security and privacy issues.

Furthermore, ensuring network stability and performance is crucial. Public blockchains can become congested when many users use them simultaneously, causing transaction delays and high fees.


### Benefits of Developing a Proprietary Layer 2

By developing its own Layer 2 solution, Animechain.ai can implement functions specialized for anime production and promote sustainable growth of the ecosystem. Developing a proprietary Layer 2 offers the following benefits:

First, it ensures data security and privacy. Data related to anime production often includes highly confidential information such as copyright information and personal information. While there is a risk of this information leaking on public blockchains, using a proprietary Layer 2 solution allows for detailed data management and access permission settings. This prevents the leakage of confidential information and ensures data security and privacy.

Implementing functions specialized for anime generative AI is also a significant benefit of developing a proprietary Layer 2. Existing blockchains and Layer 2 solutions are designed to address general use cases, making it difficult to meet the specific requirements of anime generative AI. For example, there are specific requirements for anime production, such as the need to handle high-resolution image and video data, manage intellectual property rights, and appropriately distribute rewards to creators. To meet these requirements, it is necessary to design smart contracts specific to Animechain.ai. By developing its own Layer 2, Animechain.ai can flexibly implement these functions specialized for anime production. Specifically, by introducing data structures and AI model management methods optimized for anime production, it becomes possible to operate anime generative AI more efficiently and safely.

Developing a proprietary Layer 2 significantly improves the ability to adapt to future technological innovations. Blockchain technology is rapidly evolving, with new protocols and features constantly emerging. By developing its own Layer 2, Animechain.ai can flexibly incorporate these latest technologies. This realizes high-speed and low-cost transaction processing with high security and scalability. Additionally, by considering chain abstraction in system design, it facilitates coordination between different blockchain protocols and aims to improve future interoperability. This allows for seamless collaboration with other anime production platforms and cross-chain data sharing, enabling flexible response to future technical requirements. The development of a proprietary Layer 2 will be an important foundation supporting Animechain.ai's long-term growth and development.

In this way, by developing its own Layer 2 solution, Animechain.ai provides a high-performance platform optimized for the anime production industry and supports the sustainable growth of the ecosystem. Leveraging the benefits of ensuring data security and privacy, implementing functions specialized for anime generative AI, ensuring technical flexibility, and introducing a unique governance model, Animechain.ai leads the utilization of blockchain technology in anime production.


### Adoption of Next-Generation Layer 2 Technology: Fusion of Optimistic Rollup and Verifier Network

Animechain.ai adopts Optimistic Rollup as its Layer 2 technology. Optimistic Rollup is a technology that improves scalability and efficiency by processing transactions off-chain and posting the results in batches to the main chain. This technology allows users to execute transactions quickly and at low cost.

A major feature of Optimistic Rollup is its "optimistic" approach. All transactions are assumed to be valid by default, eliminating the need to verify each transaction individually, which enables faster processing and cost reduction. User transactions are quickly processed off-chain and later batched and posted to the main chain. This process significantly improves transaction processing efficiency.

However, this approach carries the possibility of fraudulent transactions slipping through. Therefore, a fraud verification system called Fraud Proof is introduced to ensure reliability. If a fraudulent transaction is detected, a verifier can submit a Fraud Proof to challenge it, and if fraud is proven, the transaction is invalidated, and the verifier is rewarded.

Animechain.ai further strengthens this Optimistic Rollup mechanism by building its own Verifier network. This Verifier network improves the decentralization and reliability of the entire system by performing transaction verification in a distributed manner. Multiple Verifiers independently verify transactions and submit Fraud Proofs to challenge if fraud is detected. This distributed verification process reduces the risk of errors or fraud by a single verifier, strengthening the security of the entire system.

Furthermore, the introduction of the Verifier network makes it possible to shorten the challenge period for Fraud Proofs. Typically, the challenge period for Optimistic Rollups often lasts 1-2 weeks, but by utilizing a distributed Verifier network, the verification speed of transactions can be improved, significantly shortening this period. This allows users to confirm transactions more quickly, providing a seamless user experience.

Through these elements, Animechain.ai combines Optimistic Rollup technology with its proprietary Verifier network to realize high-speed and low-cost transaction processing, improve user experience, and strengthen the reliability and security of the entire system. This enables Animechain.ai's ecosystem to achieve sustainable growth and development.


### Sustainable Growth of the Ecosystem through Layer 2 Solution

The introduction of Animechain.ai's Layer 2 solution is a crucial element supporting the sustainable growth of the ecosystem. Layer 2 technology enables high-speed transaction processing, reduced transaction costs, improved scalability, and ensures security and reliability, allowing all stakeholders including creators, data providers, investors, and users to use Animechain.ai's platform with confidence.

Additionally, by using AIRA (AI Rights Asset), value exchange within the ecosystem is promoted, enabling seamless transactions between creators and users. AIRA functions as a token representing rights and benefits for specific digital assets, distributing rewards to creators and data providers transparently and fairly. This further enhances the reliability of the ecosystem, establishing a foundation that supports sustainable growth.

In this way, by introducing a Layer 2 solution, Animechain.ai supports the efficiency and growth of the ecosystem, revolutionizing the future of anime production and digital content. Through the development of its proprietary Layer 2, while enjoying benefits such as ensuring data security and privacy, improving network stability, and ensuring technical flexibility, Animechain.ai incorporates the latest technological trends to provide a high-performance platform optimized for the anime production industry. The development of a proprietary Layer 2 will be an important foundation supporting Animechain.ai's long-term growth and development.
