Animechain.ai introduces Anima Blockchain, a proprietary Layer 2 solution, to improve the efficiency and scalability of the entire ecosystem. This significantly enhances transaction processing capacity and reduces transaction costs.


#### High-Speed Transaction Processing: 

Anima Blockchain greatly improves transaction processing speed. This allows users to conduct transactions quickly and at low cost. Specifically, it completes processes that traditionally take minutes to hours on conventional blockchains in seconds, significantly reducing user stress.


#### Ensuring Data Security and Privacy:

To address data security and privacy issues, which are challenges for public blockchains, we adopt a proprietary Layer 2 solution. This enables detailed data management and access permission settings. For example, it's possible to limit users who can access specific data, preventing unauthorized data access and leakage.


#### Implementation of Anime Production-Specific Functions: 

Anima Blockchain introduces data structures and generative AI model management methods optimized for anime production. This allows creators and studios to utilize anime generative AI efficiently and securely. For instance, we provide tools that facilitate the management of animation material data, intermediate generated products, and version control of generative AI models.


#### Adaptation to Future Technological Innovations: 

Anima Blockchain can flexibly incorporate the latest technologies. By appropriately adopting advanced technologies, it realizes high-speed and low-cost transaction processing with high security. This enables the entire ecosystem to continuously adapt to technological evolution.
