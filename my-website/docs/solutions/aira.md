AIRA (AI Rights Asset) is a token technology designed to protect rights and enable monetization of AI-generated content. This ensures the protection of creators' and data providers' rights and facilitates fair reward distribution.


#### Transparency and Tamper-Resistance of Rights Information: 

AIRA uses blockchain technology to manage rights information in a transparent and tamper-resistant manner. This ensures the protection of creators' copyrights and prevents unauthorized use. Specifically, all rights transactions are recorded on the blockchain and can be verified without third-party intervention.


#### Automation through Smart Contracts: 

Smart contracts are used to automate rights processing and revenue distribution. This ensures prompt and accurate distribution of rewards when revenue is generated, ensuring transparency and fairness. For example, revenue is automatically distributed to creators and data providers the moment it is generated.


#### Monetization through Tokens: 

AIRA tokens function as tokens representing rights and revenue for AI-generated content. This allows creators and data providers to fairly enjoy the revenue generated from content usage. For example, by tokenizing the usage rights of AI models and making them tradable, the liquidity of rights is enhanced.


#### Secondary Market Trading: 

AIRA tokens are tradable on the blockchain, enabling buying and selling in secondary markets. This ensures the liquidity of tokens, allowing owners to trade freely. As a result, the value of tokens is evaluated based on market principles.

Animechain.ai's AIRA provides a new paradigm for rights protection and monetization in the anime industry. This not only protects creators' rights and ensures fair distribution of revenue but also promotes the growth and development of the entire anime industry.
