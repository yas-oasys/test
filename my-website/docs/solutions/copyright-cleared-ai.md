In anime production, generative AI technology has the potential to revolutionize many processes, including character design, background art creation, and automatic generation of animation scenes. However, current generative AI technology faces challenges with insufficient rights clearance for data usage. Animechain.ai aims to address this issue by promoting generative AI technology that uses data with appropriate rights clearance. This approach seeks to minimize the risk of rights infringement while providing high-quality generative AI models.


#### "Opt-in Data First" Principle: 

Animechain.ai's ultimate goal is to provide generative AI models that use only "opt-in data" with explicit permission from data owners. However, in the initial stages of the project, some use of opt-out type data is anticipated, so a phased approach will be adopted. We will start by creating models that add rights-cleared data to existing opt-out datasets or building new base models that combine both, aiming to transition to fully opt-in data as soon as possible.


#### Provision of High-Quality Anime-Oriented Generative AI Models: 

Generative AI models trained on rights-cleared data that have learned anime-specific visuals and motions will generate high-quality animations and character designs. This enables reduction in production time and costs. Specifically, generative AI can create character movements and expressions according to the creator's intentions, and with further modifications and additions, significantly improve the efficiency of the entire production process.

Intuitive Interface for AI Collaboration: Animechain.ai provides an intuitive interface for creators to collaborate more smoothly with generative AI. In addition to traditional text-based prompt instructions, creators can give more intuitive and direct instructions to generative AI through their own sketches, 3D data, and visualized UI. This maximizes creators' creativity and enables seamless collaboration with AI.


#### Ensuring Transparency and Reliability through Blockchain Technology: 

By recording data usage history and generation processes on the blockchain, transparency and reliability are ensured. Leveraging blockchain characteristics, all data transactions and generation processes are publicly available and verifiable by anyone. This allows creators and users to utilize generative AI technology with confidence.

Through these initiatives, Animechain.ai aims to provide high-quality anime generative AI technology and tools while resolving rights clearance issues. We strive to contribute to the development of the anime industry by protecting the rights of data owners while promoting innovation.
