Animechain.ai adopts a unique learning data strategy to achieve both protection of data owners' rights and promotion of innovation in the development of anime generative AI. We aim to provide new value to the anime industry by protecting the rights of individuals and companies that own anime-related data while advancing innovative technologies. This chapter explains in detail Animechain.ai's policies regarding the collection and use of learning data.


### "Opt-in Data First" Principle

Animechain.ai advocates the "opt-in data first" principle, prioritizing obtaining explicit permission from data owners in the collection and use of learning data. We aim to build a sustainable ecosystem by respecting the rights of data providers and paying appropriate compensation. While our ultimate goal is to create models composed entirely of opt-in data, we anticipate using some opt-out type data in the initial stages of the project, so we will adopt a phased approach. We will start by creating models that add rights-cleared data to existing opt-out datasets or building new base models that combine both, aiming to transition to fully opt-in data as soon as possible.

The use of opt-in data is crucial from a rights protection perspective. Unauthorized use of anime-related illustrations and image data could infringe on the rights of data owners and hinder the healthy development of the entire industry. Animechain.ai demonstrates a path to promote innovation while protecting data owners' rights through a learning data strategy centered on opt-in data.


### Multi-layered Filtering to Eliminate Risks of Rights Infringement

Animechain.ai takes a multi-layered approach to exclude elements from learning data that could lead to rights infringement. First, at the data collection stage, we implement filtering to eliminate data with high risks of rights infringement. Furthermore, for collected data, we introduce systems to automatically detect and exclude proper nouns and distinctive motifs.

Additionally, we continuously eliminate data that could pose risks of rights infringement through periodic data cleansing. This process includes visual checks by a team of experts to address subtle nuances that mechanical filtering may not capture. These multi-layered filtering processes minimize the risk of rights infringement elements being included in generated animations.


### Transparent Data Management Using Blockchain Technology

Animechain.ai aims to build trust relationships with data providers by transparently managing data usage history using blockchain technology. We believe that by allowing data providers to always be aware of how their data is being used, we can protect their rights while enhancing the reliability of AI models.

Data usage history managed on the blockchain is stored in an immutable and publicly accessible state. This not only allows data providers to confirm how their data is being used but also enables external verification of the appropriateness of Animechain.ai's data usage. This transparent data management plays an important role in enhancing Animechain.ai's accountability and improving the project's credibility.


### Data Expansion and Accuracy Improvement through Collaboration with Data Owners

Animechain.ai is expanding and improving the accuracy of learning data through close collaboration with data owners. We aim to build datasets that meet their needs by actively incorporating feedback from data owners. Additionally, we realize more realistic and attractive animation generation by utilizing high-quality data provided by partnering anime-related companies.

Collaboration with data owners contributes not only to quantitative expansion of data but also to qualitative improvement. By incorporating the specialized knowledge of individuals and companies that possess abundant anime-related data, we can reflect animation-specific expressions and worldviews in AI models. This enables us to improve the quality of generated animations and maximize the creativity of data owners.

Through this learning data strategy, Animechain.ai aims to achieve both rights protection and innovation. We strive to provide new value to the anime industry by respecting the rights of data owners while promoting innovative technologies. Appropriate collection and use of learning data is an essential element in achieving Animechain.ai's mission, and we commit to continuing to address this challenge.
