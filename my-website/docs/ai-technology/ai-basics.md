We will provide an overview of the basic mechanism of image/video generative AI and recent technological advancements. This will help understand how AI technology is being applied to anime production.

The basic principle of image/video generative AI is to learn from large-scale datasets and generate new images or videos. Particularly in the field of animation, it is used to generate various elements such as character designs, scene backgrounds, and art.

Recent technological advancements have significantly improved the performance of generative AI, enabling the generation of high-quality images and videos in a short time. This has led to increased efficiency in various stages of anime production.

Furthermore, generative AI technology reduces manual work in existing anime production processes, alleviating the burden on creators. This allows creators to focus on more creative tasks.


### Diffusion Models

Diffusion models play an important role in image generation. The basic mechanism is a method of gradually improving images containing noise to generate high-quality images.

The main features of diffusion models are stability and high accuracy. Particularly in anime image generation, the ability to faithfully reproduce detailed expressions of characters and textures of backgrounds is required. Animechain.ai is developing diffusion models optimized for anime image generation, leveraging these features.


### Fine-Tuning and Merging AI Models

Fine-tuning in image generative AI is the process of optimizing model performance according to specific styles or themes. Animechain.ai performs fine-tuning of models to match anime-specific styles and expressions.

The mainstream method of fine-tuning is fine adjustment using a small amount of data. This enables responding to specific needs without significantly changing existing models. Model merging is the process of integrating multiple models with different characteristics to create a single high-performance model. This enables diverse expressions and expands the range of anime production.


### Multimodal Generative Models

Multimodal generative models have the ability to generate by combining different modalities such as text, audio, and video. This enables integrated generation of multiple elements in anime production, such as automatic story generation, character actions, and scene sound effects.

Animechain.ai utilizes multimodal generative models to promote automation at each stage of anime production. This aims to shorten production time, improve quality, and maximize creators' creativity.
